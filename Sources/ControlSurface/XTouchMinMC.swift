/// Represent a Behringer XTouch Mini in MC (Mackey Control) mode. MC is the preferred mode.
/// 
/// - Note: Mackey Control mode is enabled by holding down the MC key while the device is connected
/// to USB. In MC mode, rotary encoders are relative, the Layer buttons do not have any built-in meaning,
/// and the application is responsible for managing all "MIDI Feedback" (device indicators for button lights
/// and encoder positions).
